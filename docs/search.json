    "section": "Professional Journey",
    "text": "Professional Journey\nBefore joining the Service, Caleb’s journey in conservation was shaped by his academic, professional, and research endeavors. His first “real world” experience was an internship at Freedom Hills Wildlife Management Area near Cherokee, Alabama. He then prepared for graduate school, taking a few courses and working as a technician at Alabama A&M University in Huntsville, Alabama. He then began his residency in Mississippi in 2014, attending the University of Mississippi for his Masters degree. His thesis research focused on understanding the effects of roads on the abundance and composition streamside salamanders.\nAfter a few years at Ole Miss, Caleb and his wife moved south to work in labs at Mississippi State University. From 2016 to 2018, Caleb worked as a Research Associate in Dr. Beth Baker’s R.E.A.C.H. lab. The project he managed while there was focused on innovative strategies to reduce nutrient and sediment loss in agricultural systems through the application of cover crops. This work contributed to reducing downstream impacts of sedimentation and nutrient runoff and helped him to learn how to address complex environmental issues through research and practical solutions.\nIn 2018, Caleb began working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Mississippi Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and pursuing his Ph.D. His dissertation research examined aspects of fisheries governance, monitoring, and management. In particular, he described and spatio-temporally compared the goals of fisheries agencies in 31 states; developed tools to help streamline and improve planning; and prototyped an formal learning approach (i.e., Bayesian updating) within a state fisheries monitoring program."

    "text": "Measuring System States\nInvasive species are typically easier to prevent than eradicate after colonization. The Lower MS River FWCO has implemented comprehensive monitoring and response for Invasive Carps in the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. This hydrological system artificially connects to drainages and threatens ecosystems and recreational opportunities in the Mobile River Basin. Our initiative focuses on measuring system states to preemptively identify and mitigate the spread of an invasive species. Luckily, our efforts have yet to record invasive carps in the TTW, but by combining early detection with immediate action, we’re able to demonstrate our commitment to protecting natural resources through informed, responsive conservation actions.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies distribution models can provide biologits with insight into species ranges, ecological niches, and spatial predictions of suitable habitat, but require significant training, data, and time for biologists to obtain reliable results. Alternatively, ad hoc inferences from sparse occurrence records leave biologists to face conservation decisions with high uncertainty. We developed Simple Models to Quickly Estimate the Probable Range of Data-limited Fiverine Fishes. Simulations indicated that the probable range of a species can be predicted using simple occurrence records. These data-efficient, easy-to-use estimators can help biologists plan future surveys and bridge the gap between ad hoc inference and complex modeling over a range of scenarios.  The “system state” is a general term that can include suitable habitat for species of interest. Measuring the condition or even location of habitat can be tricky and time consuming. We tackled this problem with a unique and rare habitat in Mississippi—sheer rock outcrops. Basic methods for Detecting Sheer Rock Outcrops Using Digital Elevation Models were established by Smith and Mullins (2022). However, while their methods effectively highlighted the contrast between slopes of sheer rock outcrops and adjacent gently sloping hillsides, it did not systematically compare sites that are completely devoid of sheer rock outcrops. But we did! On top of that, we streamlined the process and used freely available software so our results could be replicated and validated in new areas. Ultimately, our results bolstered findings in Smith and Mullins (2022) (always great to have multiple lines of evidence) and is helping support other researchers in the region leading surveys for rock outcrop specialists like the Green Salamander (Aneides aeneus).\n Green Salamander.

    "section": "Relating Human Values to System States",
    "text": "Relating Human Values to System States\nLike habitat and biodiversity loss, conservation is driven by human endeavors and values. Often our values are reflected in mission statements and strategic plans. We investigated, described, and spatio-temporally compared Contemporary Inland Fisheries Goals across 31 fisheries agencies. We identified nine distinct goal themes, but found that they do not form clear geographic patterns, which contrasts with a similar analysis conducted in the 1970s. Since that time, fisheries agencies’ goals have expanded and regionalism in goals has vanished. We think that changes in perspectives and communication technology, as well as provisions within federal funding, has led to goals becoming more homogenous across the U.S. and increased goal diversity within agencies.  While goals within strategic plans help guide the mission of an organization, objectives within management plans help the rubber meet the road. But, writing good management objectives is often more difficult than we expect. There are countless plans that contain objectives that do not really clarify what is trying to be achieved. I suspect it has something to do with the underemphasis of management and decision sciences in university coursework and early career development and research objectives are perhaps the only types of objectives folks get exposed to. For clarity, in a recently accepted paper we state:\n\nResearch or analytical objectives are “active statement[s] about how the study [or analysis] is going to answer the specific research question[s]” (Farrugia et al., 2010). Management objectives, however, are “statements of the fundamental interests that could be affected by a decision—the ‘things that matter’ to people” or the things that have intrinsic social and cultural value (Gregory et al., 2012). Management actions and monitoring activities are often conflated with management objectives. For example, statements such as “better understand habitat effects on bobwhite quail reproduction” (research), “monitor water quality” (monitoring), or “develop crappie length limit recommendations” (management action) are not management objectives but describe activities that serve as means of achieving various ends (i.e., management objectives).\n\nSo how can we help?! We adapted Doran’s (1981) SMART criterion for natural resource and environmental management objectives and developed a Mad Libs^TM style template to help streamline and improve management objectives writing!"

    "text": "Finding Optimal Solutions and Decision Support\nDecision-making in natural resources is complicated by multiple objectives (e.g., ecological and societal) and uncertainty in the system state, function, and response to management. Our work on brush piles in reservoirs demonstrates how enhancing and maintaining fish habitat can be done efficiently. We evaluated the longevity and structural changes of brush piles made from Eastern Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) in a drawdown reservoir, revealing a yearly loss and volume reduction that can better inform management strategies. This study, complemented by satellite imagery, offers insights into maintaining desirable brush densities and suggests that physical forces at installation sites influence brush pile durability. Our findings guide sustainable habitat management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a small-scale study of Mediterranean Gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) occupancy study, we challenged common assumptions about species detection and habitat associations. By comparing models with and without perfect detection, we highlight the importance of considering detection probability in ecological studies. Our findings suggest that certain environmental and human factors influence the detection of Mediterranean Geckos, offering a nuanced understanding of their invasive potential. This work encourages more accurate approaches to studying species distribution and emphasizes the need for methodologies that account for imperfect detection, thus helping to improve and optimize sampling designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TNCR-TTW 509 pilot project represents a groundbreaking approach to invasive carp management, utilizing a spatially explicit population model to identify optimal deterrent and removal strategies. Through simulation-optimization and genetic algorithms, we aim to minimize the invasive species’ abundance and distribution, showcasing an innovative use of technology in conservation efforts. This project exemplifies our dedication to finding effective, data-driven solutions to environmental challenges."

By identifying common management objectives and linking them with measurable attributes and actions, I developed a hierarchical framework to standardize decision-making for recurrent problems in fisheries management. Simulations suggest that leveraging information from similar systems can significantly reduce uncertainty, highlighting the efficiency of shared learning. This innovative framework emphasizes the importance of clear objectives, standardized methodologies, and adaptive management to improve fisheries management comprehensively."
