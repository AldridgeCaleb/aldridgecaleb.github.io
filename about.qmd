Welcome to Strategic Conservation, the digital portfolio of Caleb A. Aldridge's contributions to conservation science and practice. This website documents Caleb's journey and the projects to which he's contributed, underscoring his commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable conservation efforts. Additionally, this website serves as a "repository" for helpful analysis and modeling tips and tricks. 

## Current Role
Caleb is currently employed as a Biologist and Coordinator by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within the Lower Mississippi River Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office in Tupelo, Mississippi. Since he first joined USFWS 2021, his primary responsibility has been leading initiatives to prevent, control, and manage invasive carp populations in the Lower Mississippi River and the Arkansas--Red--White Rivers Sub-basins. Through these efforts, Caleb unites state, federal, academic, and industry partners, steering collaborative approaches to address this significant conservation challenge.

## Professional Journey
Before joining the Service, Caleb's journey in conservation was shaped by his academic, professional, and research endeavors. His first "real world" experience was an internship at Freedom Hills Wildlife Management Area near Cherokee, Alabama. He then prepared for graduate school, taking a few courses and working as a technician at Alabama A&M University in Huntsville, Alabama. He then began his residency in Mississippi in 2014, attending the University of Mississippi for his Masters degree. His thesis research focused on understanding the effects of roads on the abundance and composition streamside salamanders.

After a few years at Ole Miss, Caleb and his wife moved south to work in labs at Mississippi State University. From 2016 to 2018, Caleb worked as a Research Associate in Dr. Beth Baker's R.E.A.C.H. lab. The project he managed while there was focused on innovative strategies to reduce nutrient and sediment loss in agricultural systems through the application of cover crops. This work contributed to reducing downstream impacts of sedimentation and nutrient runoff and helped him to learn how to address complex environmental issues through research and practical solutions.

In 2018, Caleb began working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Mississippi Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and pursuing his Ph.D. His dissertation research examined aspects of fisheries governance, monitoring, and management. In particular, he described and spatio-temporally compared the goals of fisheries agencies in 31 states; developed tools to help streamline and improve planning; and prototyped an formal learning approach (i.e., Bayesian updating) within a state fisheries monitoring program. 

## Collaborative Leadership and Expertise
Caleb's approach to conservation is deeply rooted in participatory decision-making, ensuring all stakeholders have a voice in understanding and tackling conservation challenges. He adeptly facilitates discussions to properly frame problems, clarify objectives, identify available actions and strategies, and develop models to encapsulate current ecological understanding and societal values. Furthermore, his proficiency in analysis---including population modeling, systems analysis, trade-off analysis, and optimization---enhances decision-making processes, providing a solid foundation for effective conservation strategies.
