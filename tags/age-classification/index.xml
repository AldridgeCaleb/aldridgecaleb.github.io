      <description>Fish length and age are common measurements collected by fisheries agencies. Together with catch per unit, agencies can assess important population parameters such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. But estimating age of individual fish is costly (e.g., time, fish mortality), and age structure is typically estimated from a subsample and expanded to whole sample. Expanding and estimating age structure of the sample is done using a probability matrix of age and length-class to partition individuals of the complete sample (age-length key [ALK]).</description>
