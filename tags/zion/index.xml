      <description>Lee&amp;rsquo;s Ferry and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (red cliffs) At the end of Part II in this series we had just been floored by the majesty of the Grand Canyon.

We were now driving towards Page, AZ, but would head west on HWY-89A before reaching the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell.</description>
