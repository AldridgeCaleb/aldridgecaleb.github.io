I am a graduate research assistant and PhD student studying decision making in fisheries resources under the guidance of Drs. [Michael Colvin](https://mcolvin.github.io/) and [Leandro (Steve) Miranda](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/People/Leandro_Miranda/index.html). We're housed in the [Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department](http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/wildlife/) within the [College of Forest Resources](http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/) at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/). I'm supported by the [Mississippi Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/index.html) and the [Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks](http://www.mdwfp.com/). 

My studies and research focus on sampling and monitoring protocols of state fisheries agencies across the U.S. and the decision-making process used to take action using metrics from such protocols. Part of my research is building a web application to be used by MDWFP fisheries biologists in constructing lake management plans based on monitoring data and will integrate decision analysis when considering alternative actions.
