## Lee's Ferry and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (red cliffs)

At the end of [Part II](https://aldridgecaleb.github.io/blog/GP2GC-II/) in this series we had just been floored by the majesty of the Grand Canyon. From the South Rim Visitors Center we were making our way west on HWY-89; our last stop was the Desert Watchtower. We were now driving towards Page, AZ, but would head west on HWY-89A before reaching the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell.

United States Highway-89 Alternate detours from HWY-89 about 30 miles south of Page, AZ, paralleling the contact point between the grayish-tan Permian Sedimentary Rocks and the reds of the Moenkopi, Chinle, and Glen Canyon formations ([AZGS, 2013](http://data.azgs.az.gov/geologic-map-of-arizona/)). (You can see the colors from satellite imagery, just take a look at the Google map below with our route in blue). This area is better know as the [Vermilion Cliffs](https://www.blm.gov/visit/vermilion-cliffs), [Marble Canyon](http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/vermilion_cliffs/national_monument.html), or sometimes the Red Cliffs. HWY-89A then crossed the Colorado River at [Lee's Ferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%27s_Ferry), a unique geographic location where the river is easily crossed. Because it is literally the easiest access and crossing point for dozens, if not hundreds, of miles, making Lee's Ferry a culturally, historically, and politically important place.

Poppa recalled how it "was a military outpost and the only way to cross the river until the [[historic] Navajo Bridge](https://www.nps.gov/glca/learn/historyculture/navajobridge.htm) was built in the 1920s or 30s"; he wasn't exactly sure, he said. Both the historic and modern bridges dwarf any we have near home---830+ ft. in length and ~470 ft. above the river. The engineering spectacle, however, was outdone by the breathtaking scenery.

## Zion Canyon National Park (a holy valley)

After leaving the Vermillion Cliffs we soon rejoined HWY-89 and made our way towards our temporary domicile in Kanab, UT. We could add another state to our growing list.

The next morning we were off to Zion Canyon National Park, one of my favorite places I've ever visited. I was confident this would be an exciting rejuvenation because most of our sightseeing had been into a canyon or at uplifts in the far distance; we'd be in a canyon looking out for the first time. Plus ZCNP is just as unique and exciting as all the other places we'd been.   

The 'oohs' and 'aahs' upon first sight of rock formations confirmed my suspicion.

Cade and Dad (Robert) were especially impressed by the tunnel going into the park.

We drove as far as we could--summer visitor traffic is restricted--then visited the park visitor center and [Zion Human History Museum](https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/historyculture/zion-human-history-museum.htm). Equipped with history of the park, we hopped a bus to see the sights along the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. One of the first stops, the Court of the Patriarchs.

My attention was apparently on things in the park and watching my family's reactions... I don't have many photos from this part of the trip. What I'm not able to show you is the [peregrine falcon (*Falco peregrinus*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_falcon) (known for its high speed hunting dives of 200+ mph), the dozens of rock squirrels (*Otospermophilus variegatus*), and a few mule deer (*Odocoileus hemionus*) that were along the roadway and footpaths. We also enjoyed stunning views of the [Virgin River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_River), the carving tool used to form Zion Canyon, and a number of waterfalls (e.g., Weeping Rock and Emerald Pools)---it's an oasis in the desert. Everyone gasp when I pointed out the viewpoint at the end of Angel's Landing where I'd stood just over a year before.

*The path along Angel's Landing Trail (2015) is quite narrow in some places---never mind the 700 ft. drop.*

I had been thinking about the Canyon Overlook Trail for a few days; I really wanted my grandparents to hike it. It's a short trail, not as dangerous as Angel's Landing trail, but with a grand reward. I pointed it out on our way in; the parking lot is just to the left before entering the east entrance tunnel. "Coincidentally" we had just enough time that afternoon to hike it. (I was a little surprised there was no opposition to the suggestion).

The first little bit is a pretty steep incline but levels off after that. There are a couple places where it gets tight, but really there is plenty of room along the trail to stay safe. It looks a little scarier than it really is, which is a good kind of thrill!

The trail takes 30-60 min. to complete each way (in and out). After our short break we were looking over the canyon in awe.

That is a good trail for family; short and sweet.

I made sure to point out the Thunderbird Restaurant, home of Ho-made Pies. It's a familiar sight to most who have been through the area.

We crashed in Kanab another night. The next day we'd be visiting Bryce Canyon National Park. Most of the popular vistas in Bryce can be accessed via a short walk from adjacent parking lots---it was a welcome rest as we were all wore from the riding and hiking.


## Bryce Canyon National Park (hoodid what?)

We had started August out right--hiking to the Canyon Overlook--and we weren't stopping, though this day would be much more relaxed. We drove to Bryce, UT the morning of August 2^nd, straight to the top.

9,100 feet (2778 m).

Poppa had crossed the Big Muddy, Nanna had looked clear across the Grand Canyon. Now they were breathing air thinner than even the driest and coldest in Alabama. We were almost two miles from sea level. What an experience.

Bryce Canyon doesn't disappoint. It may be more "touristy" in feel than some of the other parks because it is basically has a main drag that runs from bottom to top but the views are outstanding.

We took the scenic route from BCNP to Moab, UT. This is a windy, adventurous road. Breathtaking at every new turn and hilltop. David can tell you just how exciting it can be, especially when a loaded 18-wheeler meets you in a blind, uphill, hairpin turn. We needed to pull off and walk off that excitement.

Later that evening we made it to Moab. The next couple days would be spent in Canyonlands and Arches National Parks.
