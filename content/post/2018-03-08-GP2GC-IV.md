## Fractals

I remember the first time I ever learned of a fractal. There was this screensaver on the old Windows '95 OS that was either a maze of with the walls a fractals or it morphed into a continuous fractal shape... I'm not certain. I do remember that I could watch it for a few minutes---which is an eternity when you are a first grader. I'm pretty sure it was the screensaver in the clip below.

*I'm pretty sure this was the exact sreensaver.*

I think that was the first time my dad rightly blew my mind. I was already flipping over how cool and beautiful this never-ending cascade of nested shapes and forms. Then he's like, "Cool huh? We can describe this with mathematics and this pattern is seen in nature all the time." Honestly, that moment and my afternoons at Dale Walker's were probably why I loved STEM related fields at such a young age.

Now I got to show my dad one of the most amazing displays of fractals known to man.

I love the views and vistas in Canyonlands.

## Schafer

Just past the Island in the Sky Visitor Center is the Shafer Canyon Overlook. You may notice what looks to be nothing more than a walking trail in the photos below. It's actually an 18 mile off-road dirt track that can be accessed near the entrance of Canyonlands NP and just outside Moab (near the entrance of Arches NP). You can learn more about the Shafer Trail [here](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/shafer-trail) or [here](http://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/usa/591-shafer-trail-road-usa.html). The Shafer trail is actually part of a larger trail called the [White Rim Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rim_Road) that follows the top of the [White Rim Sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rim_Sandstone) formation below the Island in the Sky (CNP)--you can faintly see the white sandstone in some of the pictures.

Robert and David were excited to see this famous off-roading trail and pledged there would be a return trip one day to tackle it.

## Views from the Mesa

[Mesa Arch](https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/most-visited-parks/canyonlands/family-guide/mesa-arch/) is pretty recognizable for Windows 7 users (it was one of the standard backgrounds) and, I think, is, or was, featured in Las Vegas Airport. Mesa Arch is an icon at CNP for its beauty and family friendly access (beginner trail). One of its most dramatic features is that the arch sits at the edge of a 500+ ft drop-off. The early morning views are perhaps the most colorful.

One of the most amazing aspects of the arches near Moab, UT is--the best supported hypothesis--their formation was by geologic rise and water. Through precipitation, erosion, and freezing water has exposed folded sandstone and chipped away at small fractures over many years. To learn more about this process check out this [Geologic Formations](https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm) page on the Arches National Park site and this [3-dimensional model of Landscape Arch](https://www.nps.gov/articles/active-process-monitoring-example-landscape-arch.htm) in Arches National Park, Utah.

Oh, and did I mention how cool the vegetation is in the Southwest?

## Arches or bridges? It's all about water

Above I mentioned the power of water in carving and chipping away at rock to sculpt amazing geologic formations and gave links to some information of formations in Arches National Park. Well, I'd now like to show you a few of those amazing sculptures.

One arch that we didn't see on our visit was Delecate Arch. It's a strenuous hike to get to it and we were pressed for time. I was able to visit it in 2015 with Randi (wife) and Robin (father-in-law).
