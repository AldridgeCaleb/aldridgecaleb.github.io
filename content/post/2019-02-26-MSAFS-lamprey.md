A member of the Southern Brook Lamprey Research Group has been actively tracking the number and location of captured individuals. She has also been diligent in taking careful total length measures and classifying individuals into life-stages based on physical characteristics. Bayley was able to share her research with the SBLRG and with our minor contributions presented the slides below at the 45th Mississippi AFS meeting.

*Abstract.* The ecology of many non-game fish species is understudied, thus little information is known about the life-history and population structure of diverse fishes. Very little is known about the spatial structure and abundances of Southern Brook Lamprey populations, and less is known about their early life-history and ontogeny outside of living for up to seven years and experiencing an ammocoete, metamorphosis, and adult life stage. We estimated lamprey abundance at seven stream reaches in Panther Creek to describe their population structure and identify factors that affect the metamorphosis from ammocoetes to adult. We electro-fished hundred meter reaches along the creek beginning March 2018. Captured individuals were measured for total length, photographed for morphological analyses in the ImageJ software, and assigned to one of the three life stages based on the development of gill slits, caudal fins, and photopic vision. Southern Brook Lamprey were not present in the left fork of the creek, and 124 individuals were captured across the sites where lamprey were present. There was a 26% chance of an individual being metamorphic or an adult if it is at least 120 mm long and approximately a 59% chance at 150mm. It is possible that there is another environmental or biological influence of metamorphosis which has yet to be determined because even at lengths larger than 150mm ammocoetes have been documented. Additional sampling of Panther Creek will provide clarity about the population structure and distribution of lamprey in this watershed and potentially identify mechanisms that regulate transition between life stages. Identifying potential metamorphosis triggers would allow for management efforts to be put in place to increase reproductive and recruitment rates, thus allowing Southern Brook Lamprey to avoid the endangered species list like the Northern Brook Lamprey.
