## We're going on a trip...
### [...in our favorite rocket ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eL1Bfv8Y9k)  ♪ ♫

Our rocket ship happens to be the same RAM 1500 we took on our trip the the Grand Canyon back in 2016 ([link](https://aldridgecaleb.github.io/blog/GP2GC-I/) to that trip). What's more exciting is that my aunt, Matilda, will be on this trip! I think she was a little envious of the experiences we shared on the trip prior and wasn't going to let the opportunity pass her by. Truth be told she's been nudging and planning for us to do another big trip since we got back. Her persistence and patientce (2 years!) is paying off! And what a reward too; Yellowstone National Park!
