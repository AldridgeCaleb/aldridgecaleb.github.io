Fish length and age are common measurements collected by fisheries agencies. Together with catch per unit, agencies can assess important population parameters such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. But estimating age of individual fish is costly (e.g., time, fish mortality), and age structure is typically estimated from a subsample and expanded to whole sample. Expanding and estimating age structure of the sample is done using a probability matrix of age and length-class to partition individuals of the complete sample (age-length key [ALK]). Aging mistakes, to appropriately include data stratification, and instances of many ages represented in a length-class can introduce error when using ALK to age structure to unaged fish. The use of covariates can more accurately assign an age to unaged fish, but additional data collection can resource limited. Since it is likely that only length and age data will be used to estimate population age structure and growth we evaluated if the of correct age classifications (sensitivity) could be improved using a naïve Bayes classifier (NB) relative to an ALK.
