These are the slides from my Masters thesis presentation. The PowerPoint file of my presentation became corrupt just two nights before the presentation! It was a crazy shuffle, but I managed to get a skeleton presentation together and passed my thesis defense. Looking back, I could have been better prepared in preventing the file corruption and the presentation itself. It's always good to keep track of where you've come from though.

This is a poster that Brent Chaney presented at a Miss. State Univ. undergraduate symposium in 2017. I worked with him on producing the graphs and analyzing the data to get at the questions he was asking.
