Southern Brook Lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei, is a primitive, non-parasitic filter feeder that lives in sandy streams in the Southeastern United States. They experience three life stages: (1) ammocoete, (2) metamorphosis, and (3) adult. This study aims to assess the presence of Southern Brook Lamprey at nine sites within a small watershed, Panther Creek, on the Tombigbee National Forest just south of Starkville, Mississippi.
