title: "Ichthyology"

Ichthyology is the study of fish. (The literal Greek *ikhthys* means "fish" and *logos* means "study"). I cannot claim I am anything beyond novice in this area. Really, most of my experience is second-hand (assisting other in the field), working on a particular species ([southern brook lamprey, *Ichthyomyzon gagei*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_brook_lamprey)), or what is relevant to my dissertation research.
