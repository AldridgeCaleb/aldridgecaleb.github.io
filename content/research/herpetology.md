title: "Herpetology"

Herpetology, *herpet√≥n* means "creeping animal" and *ology*, of course, mean "study," is focused on amphibians (e.g., frogs, toads, and salamanders) and reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards, and turtles). I have been amazed by herps my entire life. I would have two to three week-long "pets" every summer. Heck, one of the first animals my family ever had was a (corn snake [*Pantherophis guttatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_snake)).
