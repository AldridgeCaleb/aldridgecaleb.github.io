Whether by design or by accident most of the research with which I have been involved relates back to conservation of aquatic resources---sometimes organisms that depend on water, sometimes the water. My first "research" was flipping logs, digging in gravel, and diving in streams as a kid to look at bugs, worms, salamanders, and crawfish. Some people are fortunate to grow up in money, I was fortunate enough to grow up in [species] riches. Alabama, and all the Southeast U.S., is a naturally diverse place. Don't just take my word for it, take it from distinguished biologist, professor, Pulitzer Prize winning and New York Times bestselling author, and Alabama native, [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson).

*Published by AL.com on November 27th, 2014. Scientist E.O. Wilson, born in Birmingham and raised in Mobile, in a clip from "America's Amazon," talks about the biodiversity found in the Mobile River Basin, in particular the Mobile-Tensaw Delta.*

I'm thankful to have grown up with many great outdoor experiences, and to have parents that instilled a love for nature in me as a child. Fast-forward a couple decades and that love has allowed me to have been involved with baseline recording of water quality parameters for small standing waters in the city of Florence, AL (Fig. 1---unpublished report, 2011); monitoring of streamflow, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen in Bankhead National Forest, AL (Fig. 2---from CFEA Subproject III Presentation, 2014); participation in white-tailed deer camera trap surveys, banding of mourning dove, and eastern turkey liver biopsy from the Freedoms Hills Wildlife Management Area, AL (Fig. 3 & 4); the study of how road-crossings affect stream-associated salamander counts and species richness in Holly Springs National Forest, MS (Table 1 & 2---Aldridge, 2017, master's thesis); study of the effects of winter cover crops on soil and water quality in north MS (Fig. 5 & 6---Aldridge & Baker, in prep); and am currently investigating ways to improve fisheries science and management in Mississippi through informatics.

I hope to give each of those topics (and possibly others I forgot) more structure and detail in time--so pardon my progress for now.

#### Disturbance Ecology

*__Table 1.__ Select (main interests in study) p-values for analysis of variance of most abundant stream-associated salamander species (&alpha; = 0.1). These results indicate that roads likely reduced the observed number of E. guttolineata and P. mississippi in headwater stream habitat, but this effect is diminished with distance from the road crossing for E. guttolineata.*  

| Species | *n* | Road | Road---Distance |
|:-------:|:---:|:---- |:-------------- |
| *E. guttolineata* | 149 | 0.08 | 0.05 |
| *P. mississippi* | 81 | <0.01 | NS |
| *E. cirrigera* | 23 | NS | NS |  

*__Table 2.__ Observed number of individuals of most abundant stream-associated salamander species in road-crossed and road-free headwater stream habitat (G-test of independence = 17.15, p-value = <0.01).*  

| Species | Road-crossed | Road-free | % Difference |
|:-------:|:------------ |:--------- |:------------ |
| *E. guttolineata* | 58 | 91 | 36% |
| *P. mississippi* | 15 | 66 | 77% |
| *E. cirrigera* | 2 | 21 | 90% |

*Figure 5. Boxplots of compaction (i.e., soil penetration resistance measurements; psi) of three winter cover types (wheat, rye, and corn residue). The horizontal dotted line near center of boxplots represents the median compaction reading; notches extending from median represent the 95% CI of the median; bounds of boxes represent the 25^th (lower) and 75^th (upper) percentiles of data points; whiskers extending from boxes include 49.3% of remaining data points. Means of cover types are plotted as black dots with bars representing 95% CI of means. Letters above boxplots indicate statistically significant differences between groups---groups which share letters do not differ and groups which do not share letters differ. Orange and red horizontal lines represent levels at which root penetration is slowed or halted, respectively.*
