      <description>Herpetology, herpet√≥n means &amp;ldquo;creeping animal&amp;rdquo; and ology, of course, mean &amp;ldquo;study,&amp;rdquo; is focused on amphibians (e.g., frogs, toads, and salamanders) and reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards, and turtles). I have been amazed by herps my entire life. I would have two to three week-long &amp;ldquo;pets&amp;rdquo; every summer. Heck, one of the first animals my family ever had was a (corn snake Pantherophis guttatus).</description>

      <description>Ichthyology is the study of fish. (The literal Greek ikhthys means &amp;ldquo;fish&amp;rdquo; and logos means &amp;ldquo;study&amp;rdquo;). I cannot claim I am anything beyond novice in this area. Really, most of my experience is second-hand (assisting other in the field), working on a particular species (southern brook lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei,), or what is relevant to my dissertation research.</description>

      <description>Whether by design or by accident most of the research with which I have been involved relates back to conservation of aquatic resources&amp;mdash;sometimes organisms that depend on water, sometimes the water. My first &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; was flipping logs, digging in gravel, and diving in streams as a kid to look at bugs, worms, salamanders, and crawfish. Some people are fortunate to grow up in money, I was fortunate enough to grow up in [species] riches.</description>
