      <description>I am a research assistant and PhD student studying decision making in fisheries resources under the guidance of Drs. Michael Colvin and Leandro (Steve) Miranda. We&amp;rsquo;re housed in the Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department within the College of Forest Resources at Mississippi State University. I&amp;rsquo;m supported by the Mississippi Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks.
My studies and research focus on sampling and monitoring protocols of state fisheries agencies across the U.</description>

      <description>Herpetology, herpetón means &amp;ldquo;creeping animal&amp;rdquo; and ology, of course, mean &amp;ldquo;study,&amp;rdquo; is focused on amphibians (e.g., frogs, toads, and salamanders) and reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards, and turtles). I have been amazed by herps my entire life. I would have two to three week-long &amp;ldquo;pets&amp;rdquo; every summer. Heck, one of the first animals my family ever had was a (corn snake Pantherophis guttatus).</description>

      <description>Ichthyology is the study of fish. (The literal Greek ikhthys means &amp;ldquo;fish&amp;rdquo; and logos means &amp;ldquo;study&amp;rdquo;). I cannot claim I am anything beyond novice in this area. Really, most of my experience is second-hand (assisting other in the field), working on a particular species (southern brook lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei,), or what is relevant to my dissertation research.</description>

      <description>Whether by design or by accident most of the research with which I have been involved relates back to conservation of aquatic resources&amp;mdash;sometimes organisms that depend on water, sometimes the water. My first &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; was flipping logs, digging in gravel, and diving in streams as a kid to look at bugs, worms, salamanders, and crawfish. Some people are fortunate to grow up in money, I was fortunate enough to grow up in [species] riches.</description>

      <title>Ontogeny of Southern Brook Lamprey (Ichthyomyzon gagei) with emphasis on abundance, distribution, and morphology in a small watershed</title>

      <description>Southern Brook Lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei, is a primitive, non-parasitic filter feeder that lives in sandy streams in the Southeastern United States. They experience three life stages: (1) ammocoete, (2) metamorphosis, and (3) adult. This study aims to assess the presence of Southern Brook Lamprey at nine sites within a small watershed, Panther Creek, on the Tombigbee National Forest just south of Starkville, Mississippi.

      <description>Fish length and age are common measurements collected by fisheries agencies. Together with catch per unit, agencies can assess important population parameters such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. But estimating age of individual fish is costly (e.g., time, fish mortality), and age structure is typically estimated from a subsample and expanded to whole sample. Expanding and estimating age structure of the sample is done using a probability matrix of age and length-class to partition individuals of the complete sample (age-length key [ALK]).</description>

      <description>A member of the Southern Brook Lamprey Research Group has been actively tracking the number and location of captured individuals. She has also been diligent in taking careful total length measures and classifying individuals into life-stages based on physical characteristics. Bayley was able to share her research with the SBLRG and with our minor contributions presented the slides below at the 45th Mississippi AFS meeting.
Abstract. The ecology of many non-game fish species is understudied, thus little information is known about the life-history and population structure of diverse fishes.</description>

      <title>Assessing Viability of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags for Ecological Studies of Lamprey Ammocoetes</title>
      <link>/post/2018-10-05-afs2018-lamprey/</link>

      <description>Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are widely used to study movement and habitat preferences in large-bodied fish species. However, relatively large tag sizes have traditionally limited their suitability for small-bodied fishes. Technological advances have recently led to the production of smaller PIT tags (8.0 x 1.4 mm) that may prove useful to the study of small-bodied fish species, particularly those of conservation importance. Southern Brook Lamprey (Ichthyomyzon gagei) are small-bodied, filiform fish.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going on a trip&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;in our favorite rocket ship ♪ ♫ Our rocket ship happens to be the same RAM 1500 we took on our trip the the Grand Canyon back in 2016 (link to that trip). What&amp;rsquo;s more exciting is that my aunt, Matilda, will be on this trip! I think she was a little envious of the experiences we shared on the trip prior and wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to let the opportunity pass her by.</description>

      <description>Mesa Verde So my granddad (Poppa) has well-rounded interests and when two or more of those interest can be sparked by a single place or topic he&amp;rsquo;s a very perky fellow. The cultural and natural significance of Mesa Verde NP was such that we all were perked up. (More to come on this).
Traveling Back The drive home wasn&amp;rsquo;t too eventful, especially in light of what we had just experienced.</description>

      <description>Fractals I remember the first time I ever learned of a fractal. There was this screensaver on the old Windows &amp;lsquo;95 OS that was either a maze of with the walls a fractals or it morphed into a continuous fractal shape&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not certain. I do remember that I could watch it for a few minutes&amp;mdash;which is an eternity when you are a first grader. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it was the screensaver in the clip below.</description>

      <description>Lee&amp;rsquo;s Ferry and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (red cliffs) At the end of Part II in this series we had just been floored by the majesty of the Grand Canyon. From the South Rim Visitors Center we were making our way west on HWY-89; our last stop was the Desert Watchtower. We were now driving towards Page, AZ, but would head west on HWY-89A before reaching the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell.</description>

      <description>Get some sleep In Part I of this series I gave a briefing on travel plans of getting my paternal grandparents to the Grand Canyon and beyond. When I left off, we had just arrived at our hotel the evening before we were to visit GCNP.
&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;[E]veryone was buzzing with excitement&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and for different reasons. On this trip had come myself, my paternal grandparents (aka, Nana and Poppa), my Mom (Amy), Dad (Robert), and brother (David), and an uncle-in-law (Uncle Bryan) and first cousin (Cade).</description>

      <description>Setting the stage(coach)  Quick note: This is the first in a short series about a trip I and family members took in July&amp;ndash;August of 2016. It may be a little longer and sappier than some are willing to endure, and I&amp;rsquo;m not that captivating of a writer. So if you&amp;rsquo;d like to skip to the photographs of our trip click here. After all, &amp;ldquo;One picture [is] worth ten thousand words&amp;rdquo; (Fred R.</description>

      <description>These are the slides from my Masters thesis presentation. The PowerPoint file of my presentation became corrupt just two nights before the presentation! It was a crazy shuffle, but I managed to get a skeleton presentation together and passed my thesis defense. Looking back, I could have been better prepared in preventing the file corruption and the presentation itself. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to keep track of where you&amp;rsquo;ve come from though.</description>
