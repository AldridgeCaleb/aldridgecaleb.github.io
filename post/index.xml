      <description>Southern Brook Lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei, is a primitive, non-parasitic filter feeder that lives in sandy streams in the Southeastern United States. They experience three life stages: (1) ammocoete, (2) metamorphosis, and (3) adult. This study aims to assess the presence of Southern Brook Lamprey at nine sites within a small watershed, Panther Creek, on the Tombigbee National Forest just south of Starkville, Mississippi.

      <description>I recently presented on my proposed dissertation research. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this will evolve as time goes by&amp;mdash;this is the launching pad.

      <description>Fish length and age are common measurements collected by fisheries agencies. Together with catch per unit, agencies can assess important population parameters such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. But estimating age of individual fish is costly (e.g., time, fish mortality), and age structure is typically estimated from a subsample and expanded to whole sample. Expanding and estimating age structure of the sample is done using a probability matrix of age and length-class to partition individuals of the complete sample (age-length key [ALK]).</description>

      <description>A member of the Southern Brook Lamprey Research Group has been actively tracking the number and location of captured individuals. She has also been diligent in taking careful total length measures and classifying individuals into life-stages based on physical characteristics. Bayley was able to share her research with the SBLRG and with our minor contributions presented the slides below at the 45th Mississippi AFS meeting.
Abstract. The ecology of many non-game fish species is understudied, thus little information is known about the life-history and population structure of diverse fishes.</description>

      <title>Assessing Viability of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags for Ecological Studies of Lamprey Ammocoetes</title>

      <description>Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are widely used to study movement and habitat preferences in large-bodied fish species. However, relatively large tag sizes have traditionally limited their suitability for small-bodied fishes. Technological advances have recently led to the production of smaller PIT tags (8.0 x 1.4 mm) that may prove useful to the study of small-bodied fish species, particularly those of conservation importance. Southern Brook Lamprey (Ichthyomyzon gagei) are small-bodied, filiform fish.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going on a trip&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;in our favorite rocket ship ♪ ♫ Our rocket ship happens to be the same RAM 1500 we took on our trip the the Grand Canyon back in 2016 (link to that trip). What&amp;rsquo;s more exciting is that my aunt, Matilda, will be on this trip! I think she was a little envious of the experiences we shared on the trip prior and wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to let the opportunity pass her by.</description>

      <description>Mesa Verde So my granddad (Poppa) has well-rounded interests and when two or more of those interest can be sparked by a single place or topic he&amp;rsquo;s a very perky fellow. The cultural and natural significance of Mesa Verde NP was such that we all were perked up. (More to come on this).
Traveling Back The drive home wasn&amp;rsquo;t too eventful, especially in light of what we had just experienced.</description>

      <description>Fractals I remember the first time I ever learned of a fractal. There was this screensaver on the old Windows &amp;lsquo;95 OS that was either a maze of with the walls a fractals or it morphed into a continuous fractal shape&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not certain. I do remember that I could watch it for a few minutes&amp;mdash;which is an eternity when you are a first grader. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it was the screensaver in the clip below.</description>

      <description>Lee&amp;rsquo;s Ferry and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (red cliffs) At the end of Part II in this series we had just been floored by the majesty of the Grand Canyon. From the South Rim Visitors Center we were making our way west on HWY-89; our last stop was the Desert Watchtower. We were now driving towards Page, AZ, but would head west on HWY-89A before reaching the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell.</description>

      <description>Get some sleep In Part I of this series I gave a briefing on travel plans of getting my paternal grandparents to the Grand Canyon and beyond. When I left off, we had just arrived at our hotel the evening before we were to visit GCNP.
&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;[E]veryone was buzzing with excitement&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and for different reasons. On this trip had come myself, my paternal grandparents (aka, Nana and Poppa), my Mom (Amy), Dad (Robert), and brother (David), and an uncle-in-law (Uncle Bryan) and first cousin (Cade).</description>

      <description>Setting the stage(coach)  Quick note: This is the first in a short series about a trip I and family members took in July&amp;ndash;August of 2016. It may be a little longer and sappier than some are willing to endure, and I&amp;rsquo;m not that captivating of a writer. So if you&amp;rsquo;d like to skip to the photographs of our trip click here. After all, &amp;ldquo;One picture [is] worth ten thousand words&amp;rdquo; (Fred R.</description>

      <description>This is a poster that Brent Chaney presented at a Miss. State Univ. undergraduate symposium in 2017. I worked with him on producing the graphs and analyzing the data to get at the questions he was asking.

      <description>These are the slides from my Masters thesis presentation. The PowerPoint file of my presentation became corrupt just two nights before the presentation! It was a crazy shuffle, but I managed to get a skeleton presentation together and passed my thesis defense. Looking back, I could have been better prepared in preventing the file corruption and the presentation itself. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to keep track of where you&amp;rsquo;ve come from though.</description>
